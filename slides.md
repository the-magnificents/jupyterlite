# **What is JupyterLite?**
https://jupyterlite.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html

JupyterLite is a JupyterLab distribution that **runs entirely in the browser** built from the ground-up using JupyterLab components and extensions.

**Goal:** provide a lightweight computing environment without having to install anything on the end-user device.

**Status:** The project in under active development by core Jupyter developers and is still *unofficial*.

## Architecture
JupyterLite came out of the Pyodide project, which first got Python compiled to WebAssembly working in the browser.

1. Python kernel backed by [Pyodide](https://pyodide.org/en/stable/) running in a Web Worker
   - Initial support for interactive visualization libraries such as `altair`, `bqplot`, `ipywidgets`, `matplotlib`, and `plotly`
2. View hosted example Notebooks and other files, then edit, save, and download from the browserâ€™s `IndexDB` (or `localStorage`)

---

## Pyodide and WebAssembly
Pyodide consists of the CPython 3.8 interpreter compiled to WebAssembly which allows Python to run in the browser.
